# Grocery List App

## Description:

This program will simulate a grocery shopping list. Thisprogram will start with two items on the shopping list, meat and cheese, and then allow a user to add new items to the list. To simulate shopping, this program will ask the user what item they just purchased and then remove the item from the shopping list. Upon having only two items in the shopping list, your program will inform the user that the store is out of a particular item and prompt the user to replace the item with a new item. This program will use the datetime library to display the current date and time the shopping is taking place in mm/dd hh:mm format
